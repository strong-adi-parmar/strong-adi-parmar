# Hi 👋, I'm Aditya "Adi" Parmar

### Frontend / Software Engineer · UK MSc Advanced Computer Science (Distinction)
I’m a Frontend-focused Software Engineer with professional experience in the UK building customer-facing, production React and Next.js applications in cross-functional product teams. I care deeply about code quality, performance, accessibility, and maintainability, and I enjoy bridging user needs, business goals, and engineering craft.

I’ve worked on modernising legacy systems, improving web performance and UX, and delivering scalable frontend architectures using React, Next.js, TypeScript, HTML, CSS, and Tailwind. Alongside frontend work, I’m comfortable collaborating across product, design, backend, and non-technical stakeholders to ship reliable, people-centric products.
